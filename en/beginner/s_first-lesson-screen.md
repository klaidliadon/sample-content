### TL:DR: What's the shortest way to sum up what you want to say on this screen? Don't repeat the title, add value. 

## Use subheadings

These work well to break up the content. 

## Use bullets

These work better than: 
* Long paragraphs;
* Long sentences; 
* Anything else requiring attention. 

*It's easier than you think to break up long paragraphs into key takeaways. Start phrases with verbs to focus on action items, or turn two or more nouns into a list.*

## Keep it short

Deciding what to put on one screen can be tricky. Keep it simple. If in doubt, add another section to your lesson.
